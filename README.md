# Improved Clothing

Improved Clothing is a gameplay mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studios

Improved Clothing adds a few gameplay changes and features to clothing items in the game to add a bit of difficulty and realism but also convenience. 

## Wetness

Clothing wetness is now heavily impacted by clothing condition. The worse shape the clothing is in the more wet it will become. 
Clothing wetness is also more prevalent and can accumumlate based on a few factors

### Snow and Ice

* Walking in snow and on ice has a high chance of wetting your footwear and socks.
* If your footwear have holes in them (low condition) then your socks will get wet.
* If you are wearing improper footwear like shoes, snow will overflow and wet your socks quickly.
* Different types of boots lower the chances of getting filled with snow, depending on the depth of snow (inclination).
* Wearing no footwear will instantly wet your socks if walking in snow.

* Snow pants are planned to limit wetness if you're wearing boots.

### Animal Attacks

* Being brought to the ground in snow by bears, wolves or moose will wet your outermost clothing.
* Less waterproof clothing materials like cotton, fleece, synthetic materials, etc... will get more wet than waterproof materials like wool.
* Some clothing may become mostly wet almost instantly, whereas some will only get slightly wet. There is also a randomness factor to it.

## Clothing Placement

* Configurable keybinds to place the outermost clothing item per area (hat, gloves, coat/sweater/shirt, pants/underwear, boots/socks, etc...
* Placement is instant without needing to open your clothing menu or inventory
* Perfect for quickly drying clothes or immersion
